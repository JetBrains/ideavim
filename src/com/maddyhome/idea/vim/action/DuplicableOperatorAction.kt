/**
 * There are some double-character commands like `cc`, `dd`, `yy`.
 * During the execution these commands are replaced with `c_`, `d_`, `y_`, etc.
 *
 * This is not any kind of workaround, this is exactly how the original vim works.
 *   The `dd` command (and others) should not be processed as a monolith command, or it will lead to problems
 *   like this: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/VIM-1189
 *
 * If some command implements this interface, and the user enters motion operator that is the same as the command itself, the
 *   motion operator will be replaced with `_`.
