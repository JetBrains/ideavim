/**
 * Timer to control non-vim visual selection adjustment.
 *
 * Some actions in IJ use selection as a helper to reach desired behavior. E.g. backspace in python or yaml uses
 *   selection to remove indent on the empty line. It selects indent and after that performs "remove selection" action.
 *   If IdeaVim had reacted to this selection immediately, its listeners were called twice: after selection set and
 *   after selection removing. After there both operations vim would get normal mode, what is inconvenient because user
 *   expects vim to stay in insert mode.
 *   Same approach is used in some accented characters on MacOs and for Romaji layout in Japanese language (VIM-1725).
 *
 * Because of this IdeaVim doesn't react to selection change immediately. After selection was changed, vim waits some
 *   time (100 ms by default) and enables visual mode (or any another) if selection was not changed during this time.
 *
 * If during timer sleep another selection change was performed, the old timer get's disabled and
 *   replaced with a new one.
 *
 * So, how does IdeaVim recognize that it should stay in insert mode?
 * Timer also gets an information about the current mode and whenever editor has selection.
 *   [mode] property stores information about mode of *the first timer call*. So, if there were several calls
 *   to timer, the first mode state will be stored in [mode] property. When the last timer acts, it compares state
 *   of selection before first call and expected selection state after current call. Selection adjustment gets
 *   performed only if there are changes in selection.
 *
 * Examples:
 * 1) User performs "extend selection" action from normal mode
 *
 * There will be only one call to [singleTask]. [mode] is command, editorHasSelection is true. So, selection adjustment
 *   is called, IdeaVim starts visual (or select) mode.
 *
 * 2) Some action performs "extend selection" and "shrink selection" actions sequentially from insert mode.
 *
 * First call to [singleTask]. [mode] is insert, editorHasSelection is true. Timer starts.
 * Second call to [singleTask]. First timer gets interrupted. [mode] stays insert because it's not null.
 *   editorHasSelection is false. Insert mode ([mode]) has no selection and editor also has no selection, so
 *   no adjustment gets performed and IdeaVim stays in insert mode.
