package com.maddyhome.idea.vim.listener

import java.io.Closeable

/**
 * Base class for listener suppressors.
 * Children of this class have an ability to suppress editor listeners
 *
 * E.g.
 * ```
 *  CaretVimListenerSuppressor.lock()
 *  caret.moveToOffset(10) // vim's caret listener will not be executed
 *  CaretVimListenerSuppressor.unlock()
 * ````
 *
 *  Locks can be nested:
 * ```
 *      CaretVimListenerSuppressor.lock()
 *      moveCaret(caret) // vim's caret listener will not be executed
 *      CaretVimListenerSuppressor.unlock()
 *
 *  fun moveCaret(caret: Caret) {
 *      CaretVimListenerSuppressor.lock()
 *      caret.moveToOffset(10)
 *      CaretVimListenerSuppressor.unlock()
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * [Locked] implements [Closeable], so you can use try-with-resources block
 *
 * java
 * ```
 * try (VimListenerSuppressor.Locked ignored = SelectionVimListenerSuppressor.INSTANCE.lock()) {
 *     ....
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Kotlin
 * ```
 * SelectionVimListenerSuppressor.lock().use { ... }
 * ```
