/**
 * An IntelliJ action to forward shortcuts to the ex entry component
 * <p>
 * Key events are processed by the IDE action system before they are dispatched to the actual component, which means
 * they take precedence over the keyboard shortcuts registered with the ex component as Swing actions. This can cause
 * clashes such as <C-R> invoking the Run action instead of the Paste Register ex action, or <BS> being handled by the
 * editor rather than allowing us to cancel the ex entry.
 * <p>
 * This class is an IDE action that is registered with the ex entry component, so is available only when the ex entry
 * component has focus. It registers all shortcuts used by the Swing actions and forwards them directly to the key
 * handler.
