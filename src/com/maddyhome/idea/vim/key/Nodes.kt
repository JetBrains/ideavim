/**
 * All the commands are stored into the tree where the key is either a complete command (for `x`, `j`, `l`, etc.),
 * or a part of a command (e.g. `g` for `gg`).
 *
 * This tree is pretty wide and looks like this:
 *
 *              root
 *               |
 *    -------------------------------------------
 *    |       |           |                     |
 *    j       G           g                     f
 *                        |                     |
 *                   ----------        ----------------
 *                   |        |         |      |       |
 *                   c        f         c      o       m
 *
 *
 *  Here j, G, c, f, c, o, m will be presented as a [CommandNode], and g and f as a [CommandPartNode]
 *
 *
 * If the command is complete, it's represented as a [CommandNode]. If this character is a part of command
 *   and the user should complete the sequence, it's [CommandPartNode]
