/**
 * Configuration migrator. Helps to migrate settings between different versions of IdeaVim.
 *
 * [versionDetectors] detect the version of stored settings. If this version is lower than [currentVersion], then
 *  [migrators] are applied to update the settings to the actual version of IdeaVIm settings.
 *
 * Keep in mind that [versionDetectors] and [migrators] should be stable. That means that if we can't perform migration,
 *   we should silently skip it instead of failure.
