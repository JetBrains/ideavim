IdeaVim is a Vim emulation plugin for IDEs based on the IntelliJ platform.
IdeaVim can be used with IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, CLion, PhpStorm, WebStorm,
RubyMine, AppCode, DataGrip, GoLand, Cursive, and Android Studio.

* [Continuous integration builds](http://teamcity.jetbrains.com/project.html?projectId=IdeaVim&guest=1)
* [@IdeaVim](http://twitter.com/ideavim) in Twitter


Installation
------------

Use the IDE's plugin manager to install the latest version of the plugin.
Start the IDE normally and enable the Vim emulation using "Tools | Vim
Emulator" menu item. At this point you must use Vim keystrokes in all editors.

If you wish to disable the plugin, select the "Tools | Vim Emulator" menu so
it is unchecked. At this point your IDE will work with its regular keyboard
shortcuts.

Keyboard shortcut conflicts between the Vim emulation and the IDE can be
resolved via "File | Settings | Vim Emulation", "File | Settings | Keymap" on
Linux & Windows, and by "Preferences | Other Settings | Vim Emulation",
"Preferences | Keymap" on macOS. They can also be resolved by key mapping
commands in your ~/.ideavimrc file.


Get an Early Access

Would you like to try new features and fixes? Join the Early Access Program and
receive EAP builds as updates! Add this URL to "Settings | Plugins |
Browse Repositories | Manage Repositories":
[https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/ideavim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/ideavim)

See [the changelog](CHANGES.md) for the list of hot unreleased features.

It is important to distinguish EAP from traditional pre-release software.
Please note that the quality of EAP versions may at times be way below even
usual beta standards.

* [Top features and bugs](http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/VIM?q=%23Unresolved+sort+by%3A+votes)


Files
-----

* ~/.ideavimrc
    * Your IdeaVim-specific Vim initialization commands

You can read your ~/.vimrc file from ~/.ideavimrc using this command:

    source ~/.vimrc

Note, that IdeaVim currently parses ~/.ideavimrc file via simple pattern matching,
see [VIM-669](http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/VIM-669) for proper parsing
of VimL files.

Also note that if you have overridden the `user.home` JVM option, this
will affect where IdeaVim looks for your .ideavimrc file.  For example, if you
have `-Duser.home=/my/alternate/home` then IdeaVim will source
`/my/alternate/home/.ideavimrc` instead of `~/.ideavimrc`.


Emulated Vim Plugins
--------------------

IdeaVim extensions emulate some plugins of the original Vim. In order to use
IdeaVim extensions, you have to enable them via this command in your ~/.ideavimrc:

    set <extension-name>

Available extensions:

* surround
    * Emulates [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
    * Commands: `ys`, `cs`, `ds`, `S`


Changes to the IDE
------------------

### Undo/Redo

The IdeaVim plugin uses the undo/redo functionality of the IntelliJ platform,
so the behaviour of the `u` and `<C-R>` commands may differ from the original
Vim. Vim compatibility of undo/redo may be improved in future releases.

See also [unresolved undo issues](http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/VIM?q=%23Unresolved+Help+topic%3A+u).

### Escape

Using `<Esc>` in dialog windows remains problematic. For most dialog windows
the Vim emulator is put into the insert mode with `<Esc>` not working. You
should use `<C-c>` or `<C-[>` instead. In some dialog windows the normal mode is
on by default. The usage of the Vim emulator in dialog windows is an area for
improvements.

See also [unresolved escape issues](http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/VIM?q=%23Unresolved+Help+topic%3A+i_Esc).

### Executing IDE Actions

IdeaVim adds two commands for listing and executing arbitrary IDE actions as
Ex commands or via `:map` command mappings:

* `:actionlist [pattern]`
    * Find IDE actions by name pattern
* `:action {name}`
    * Execute an action named `NAME`

For example, here `\r` is mapped to the Reformat Code action:

    :map \r :action ReformatCode<CR>


Contributing
------------

### Where to Start

In order to contribute to IdeaVim you should have some understanding of Java.

See also these docs on the IntelliJ API:

* [IntelliJ architectural overview](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/IntelliJ+IDEA+Architectural+Overview)
* [IntelliJ plugin development resources](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/PluginDevelopment)

You can start by picking relatively simple tasks that are tagged with
[#patch_welcome](http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/VIM?q=%23patch_welcome)
in the issue tracker.


### Development Environment

1. Fork IdeaVim on GitHub and clone the repository on your local machine.

2. Import the project from existing sources in IntelliJ IDEA 2017.1+ (Community or
   Ultimate) using "File | New | Project from Existing Sources..." or "Import
   Project" from the start window.

    * In the project wizard select "Import project from external model | Gradle"

    * Select your Java 8+ JDK as the Gradle JVM, leave other parameters unchanged

3. Run your IdeaVim plugin within IntelliJ via a Gradle task

    * Select "View | Tool Windows | Gradle" tool window
    
    * Launch "ideavim | intellij | runIde" from the tool window

4. Run IdeaVim tests via a Gradle task

    * Select "View | Tool Windows | Gradle" tool window
    
    * Launch "ideavim | verification | test" from the tool window

5. Build the plugin distribution by running `./gradlew clean buildPlugin` in the
   terminal in your project root.

    * The resulting distribution file is build/distributions/IdeaVim-VERSION.zip

    * You can install this file using "Settings | Plugins | Install plugin
      from disk"
