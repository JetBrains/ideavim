Setup
------------

- IdeaVim can be installed via `Settings | Plugins`.
See the [detailed instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html#).

- Use the `~/.ideavimrc` file as an analog of `~/.vimrc` ([learn more](#Files)). The XDG standard is supported, as well.

- Shortcut conflicts can be resolved by using:
     - On Linux & Windows: `File | Settings | Editor | Vim` & `File | Settings | Keymap`,
     - On macOS: `Preferences | Editor | Vim` & `Preferences | Keymap`,
     - Regular Vim mappings in the  `~/.ideavimrc` file.

Here is also a list of the suggested options from [defaults.vim](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/defaults.vim)

```vim
" Show a few lines of context around the cursor. Note that this makes the
" text scroll if you mouse-click near the start or end of the window.
set scrolloff=5

" Do incremental searching.
set incsearch

" Don't use Ex mode, use Q for formatting.
map Q gq
```
</details>


You can read your `~/.vimrc` file from `~/.ideavimrc` with this command:

    source ~/.vimrc

> :warning: Please note that IdeaVim currently parses `~/.ideavimrc` & `~/.vimrc` files via simple pattern-matching.
See [VIM-669](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/VIM-669) for proper parsing
of VimL files.

Also note that if you have overridden the `user.home` JVM option, this
will affect where IdeaVim looks for your `.ideavimrc` file. For example, if you
have `-Duser.home=/my/alternate/home` then IdeaVim will source
`/my/alternate/home/.ideavimrc` instead of `~/.ideavimrc`.

Alternatively, you can set up initialization commands using [XDG](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) standard.
Put your settings to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ideavim/ideavimrc` file.


Emulated Vim Plugins
--------------------

See [doc/emulated-plugins.md](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim/wiki/Emulated-plugins)

Executing IDE Actions
---------------------

IdeaVim adds various commands for listing and executing arbitrary IDE actions as
Ex commands or via `:map` command mappings:

### Executing actions:
* `:action {action_id}`
    * Execute an action by id. Works from Ex command line.
* `<Action>(*action_id*)`
    * For the mappings you can use a special `<Action>` keyword. Don't forget the parentheses.

### Finding actions:
* `:actionlist [pattern]`
    * Find IDE actions by id or keymap pattern (E.g. `:actionlist extract`, `:actionlist <C-D`)
    
* In addition to `:actionlist` command, IdeaVim provides `IdeaVim: track action Ids` option to 
extract the ids of executed command. This option can be found in "Search everywhere" (double `shift`).

        <img src="assets/readme/track_action_id.gif" alt="track action ids"/>
    </details>

##### Examples:

```vim
" Map \r to the Reformat Code action
:map \r <Action>(ReformatCode)

" Map <leader>d to start debug
:map <leader>d <Action>(Debug)

" Map \b to toggle the breakpoint on the current line
:map \b <Action>(ToggleLineBreakpoint)
```

##### Some popular actions:

```
QuickJavaDoc - Quick Documentation (not only for java, all languages)
ShowErrorDescription - Show description of the error under the caret (cursor hovering)
QuickImplementations - Quick Definition
```

IdeaVim tips and tricks
-------

- Use the power of IJ and Vim:
    - `set ideajoin` to enable join via the IDE. See the [examples](https://jb.gg/f9zji9).
    - Make sure `ideaput` is enabled for `clipboard` to enable native IJ insertion in Vim.
    - Sync IJ bookmarks and Vim marks: `set ideamarks`
    - Check out more [ex commands](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim/wiki/%22set%22-commands).

- Use your vim settings with IdeaVim. Put `source ~/.vimrc` in `~/.ideavimrc`.
    > :warning: Please note that IdeaVim currently parses `~/.ideavimrc` & `~/.vimrc` files via simple pattern-matching.
    See [VIM-669](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/VIM-669) for proper parsing
    of VimL files.

- Control the status bar icon via the [`ideastatusicon` option](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim/wiki/%22set%22-commands).
- Not familiar with the default behaviour during a refactoring? See the [`idearefactormode` option](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim/wiki/%22set%22-commands).

Some facts about Vim
-------

Let’s relax and have some fun now! Here are a few things we've found interesting during development
and would like to share with you.

- There are no such commands as `dd`, `yy`, or `cc`. For example, `dd` is not a separate command for deleting the line,
but a `d` command with a `d` motion.  
Wait, but there isn't a `d` motion in Vim! That’s right, and that’s why Vim has a dedicated set of commands
for which it checks whether the 
[command equals to motion](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/759d81549c1340185f0d92524c563bb37697ea88/src/normal.c#L6468)
and if so, it executes `_` motion instead.  
`_` is an interesting motion that isn't even documented in vi, and it refers to the current line.
So, commands like `dd`, `yy`, and similar ones are simply translated to `d_`, `y_`, etc.
[Here](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/759d81549c1340185f0d92524c563bb37697ea88/src/normal.c#L6502)
is the source of this knowledge.

- `x`, `D`, and `&` are not separate commands either. They are synonyms of `dl`, `d$`, and `:s\r`, respectively.
[Here](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/759d81549c1340185f0d92524c563bb37697ea88/src/normal.c#L5365)
is the full list of synonyms.

- Have you ever used `U` after `dd`? [Don't even try](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/759d81549c1340185f0d92524c563bb37697ea88/src/ops.c#L874).

- A lot of variables that refers to visual mode start with two uppercase letters, e.g. `VIsual_active`. [Some examples](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/src/normal.c#L17).

- Other [strange things](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/759d81549c1340185f0d92524c563bb37697ea88/src/ex_docmd.c#L1845) from vi:
    * ":3"       jumps to line 3
    * ":3|..."   prints line 3
    * ":|"       prints current line

- Vim script doesn't skip white space before comma. `F(a ,b)` => E475.
