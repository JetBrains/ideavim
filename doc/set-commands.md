    IdeaVim only commands:

    `ideamarks`      `ideamarks` Boolean (default true)
    
                     If true, creation of global mark will trigger creation of IDE's bookmark
                     and vice versa.
                     
    `idearefactormode` `idearefactormode` String(default "select")

                 the refactoring (renaming, live template, introduce variable, etc)
                 
                 Use one of the following values:
                 - keep  - keep the mode that was enabled before starting a refactoring
                 - select - start refactoring in select mode
                 - visual - start refactoring in visual mode
                 
                 This option has effect if you are in normal, insert or replace mode before refactoring start.
                 Visual or select mode are not changed.

    `ideastatusbar`  `ideastatusbar` Boolean (default true)
                  DEPRECATED. Please use `ideastatusicon`
    
                  If false, IdeaVim icon won't be shown in the status bar.
                  Works only from `~/.ideavimrc` after the IDE restart.
                  
    `ideastatusicon`  `ideastatusicon` String(default "enabled")
    
                 Define the behavior of IdeaVim icon in the status bar.

    `ideawaonw`     `ideawaonw` Boolean (default true) [To Be Released]
                  Read as "idea wa on w". Enables execution of ":wa" (save all) command on ":w" (save).
                  This feature exists because some IJ options like "Prettier on save" or "ESlint on save"
                       work only with "save all" action. If this option is on, these actions work
                       also with ":w" command.
                  
    `lookupkeys`    `lookupkeys`   List of strings

                        but <C-W> should be passed to IdeaVim.
                  Default value: 
                        "<Tab>", "<Down>", "<Up>", "<Enter>", "<Left>", "<Right>",
                        "<C-Down>", "<C-Up>", "<PageUp>", "<PageDown>",
