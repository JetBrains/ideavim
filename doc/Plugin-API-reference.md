Example: `&ignorecase` returns the value of the 'ignorecase' option. | The value of the option, or null if the option doesn't exist or isn't of the specified type. |
| `setGlobal<T>(name: String, value: T): Boolean` | Sets the global value of an option with the specified type. In Vim, this is equivalent to `:setglobal option=value`. Example: `:setglobal ignorecase` or `let &g:ignorecase = 1` | True if the option was set successfully, false otherwise. |
| `setLocal<T>(name: String, value: T): Boolean` | Sets the local value of an option with the specified type. In Vim, this is equivalent to `:setlocal option=value`. Example: `:setlocal ignorecase` or `let &l:ignorecase = 1` | True if the option was set successfully, false otherwise. |
| `set<T>(name: String, value: T): Boolean` | Sets the effective value of an option with the specified type. In Vim, this is equivalent to `:set option=value`. Example: `:set ignorecase` or `let &ignorecase = 1` | True if the option was set successfully, false otherwise. |
| `reset(name: String): Boolean` | Resets an option to its default value. In Vim, this is equivalent to `:set option&`. Example: `:set ignorecase&` resets the 'ignorecase' option to its default value. | True if the option was reset successfully, false otherwise. |

| `inputChar(label: String, handler: VimScope.(Char) -> Unit)` | Creates a modal input dialog with the given label and handler. The handler will be executed after the user enters a character. | None |
| `closeCurrentInput(refocusEditor: Boolean = true): Boolean` | Closes the current modal input dialog, if any. If refocusEditor is true, the editor will be refocused after closing the dialog. | True if a dialog was closed, false otherwise. |

## ListenerScope

The `ListenerScope` interface provides methods for registering callbacks for various events in the Vim editor, such as mode changes, yanking text, editor lifecycle events, and more.

### Methods

#### Mode and Action Listeners

| Method | Description | Return Value |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `onModeChange(callback: suspend VimScope.(Mode) -> Unit)` | Registers a callback that is invoked when the editor mode changes (e.g., from Normal to Insert). | None |
| `onYank(callback: suspend VimScope.(Map<CaretId, Range.Simple>) -> Unit)` | Registers a callback that is invoked when text is yanked. The callback receives a map of caret IDs to yanked text ranges. | None |

#### Editor Lifecycle Listeners

| Method | Description | Return Value |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `onEditorCreate(callback: suspend VimScope.() -> Unit)` | Registers a callback that is invoked when a new editor is created. | None |
| `onEditorRelease(callback: suspend VimScope.() -> Unit)` | Registers a callback that is invoked when an editor is released (closed). | None |
| `onEditorFocusGain(callback: suspend VimScope.() -> Unit)` | Registers a callback that is invoked when an editor gains focus. | None |
| `onEditorFocusLost(callback: suspend VimScope.() -> Unit)` | Registers a callback that is invoked when an editor loses focus. | None |

#### Macro Recording Listeners

| Method | Description | Return Value |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `onMacroRecordingStart(callback: suspend VimScope.() -> Unit)` | Registers a callback that is invoked when macro recording starts. | None |
| `onMacroRecordingFinish(callback: suspend VimScope.() -> Unit)` | Registers a callback that is invoked when macro recording finishes. | None |

#### Plugin State Listeners

| Method | Description | Return Value |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `onIdeaVimEnabled(callback: suspend VimScope.() -> Unit)` | Registers a callback that is invoked when IdeaVim is enabled. | None |
| `onIdeaVimDisabled(callback: suspend VimScope.() -> Unit)` | Registers a callback that is invoked when IdeaVim is disabled. | None |

## DigraphScope

The `DigraphScope` interface provides access to Vim's digraph functionality. Digraphs are special character combinations that produce a single character, often used for entering non-ASCII characters.

### Methods

| Method | Description | Return Value |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `getCharacter(ch1: Char, ch2: Char): Int` | Gets the character for a digraph. | The Unicode codepoint of the character represented by the digraph, or the codepoint of ch2 if no digraph is found. |

| `input(prompt: String, finishOn: Char? = null, callback: VimScope.(String) -> Unit)` | Reads input from the command line and processes it with the provided function. | None |
| `read<T>(block: suspend CommandLineRead.() -> T): Deferred<T>` | Executes a block of code in the context of read operations on the command line. This allows for reading the command line state without modifying it. | A Deferred result of the block execution. |
| `change(block: suspend CommandLineTransaction.() -> Unit): Job` | Executes a block of code in the context of transaction operations on the command line. This allows for modifying the command line state. | A Job representing the asynchronous operation. |

## CommandLineRead

The `CommandLineRead` interface provides read-only access to the command line state. It includes properties for accessing the current text, caret position, and active state of the command line.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |

| `text` | `String` | The text currently displayed in the command line. |
| `caretPosition` | `Int` | The current position of the caret in the command line. |
| `isActive` | `Boolean` | True if the command line is currently active, false otherwise. |

## CommandLineTransaction

The `CommandLineTransaction` interface provides methods for modifying the command line state. It includes operations for setting text, inserting text, setting the caret position, and closing the command line.

### Methods

| Method | Description | Return Value |
