            ## Task: Analyze UI Test Failures

            Please analyze the UI test failures in the current directory.

            Key information:
            - Test reports are located in: build/reports and tests/ui-py-tests/build/reports
            - There is a CI screen recording at build/reports/ci-screen-recording/screen-recording.mp4 that shows what happened during the entire test run - this video is usually very useful for understanding what went wrong visually
            - There is also a single screenshot at tests/ui-py-tests/build/reports/ideaVimTest.png showing the state when the test failed
            - IDE sandbox logs are in the idea-sandbox-log directory
            - ffmpeg is already installed and available. Useful commands for video analysis:
              * Extract frame at specific time: `ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -ss 00:01:30 -vframes 1 output.png`
              * Extract multiple frames: `ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf fps=1/10 frame_%04d.png` (1 frame every 10 seconds)
              * Get video duration: `ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 video.mp4`
              * Extract last N seconds: `ffmpeg -sseof -10 -i video.mp4 -update 1 last_frame.png` (last 10 seconds)
              * Create thumbnail grid: `ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf "select='not(mod(n\,300))',scale=160:120,tile=5x5" -frames:v 1 grid.png`

            Special troubleshooting for timeout failures:
            - If the test fails because it waited for something to appear, but according to the video and screenshot the element actually appeared on screen, check the UI hierarchy file at build/reports/hierarchy-ideaVimTest.html
            - This hierarchy file shows the actual structure of UI elements and their properties at the time of failure
            - The failure may be caused by a renamed property or changed class name in the UI element
            - If you find this is the case, suggest a new query or selector that matches the current element structure

            Please provide:
            1. A detailed analysis of what went wrong
            2. The root cause of the failure
            3. Potential fixes or suggestions

            Write your analysis to build/reports/ai-analysis.txt

            IMPORTANT: If you have a concrete suggestion for fixing the test, ALWAYS proceed with creating a branch and PR. Never ask for permission - just do it.

            If you have a concrete suggestion for fixing the test:
            1. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., fix/ui-test-accessible-name)
            2. Apply your suggested fix to the codebase
            3. MANDATORY: Verify compilation succeeds with your changes: `gradle compileKotlin compileTestKotlin`
            4. MANDATORY: Run the specific failing test to verify the fix improves or resolves the issue
               - For PyCharm UI tests: `gradle :tests:ui-py-tests:testUi --tests "YourTestClassName.yourTestMethod"`
               - To run all PyCharm UI tests: `gradle :tests:ui-py-tests:testUi`
               - The test MUST either pass completely or show clear improvement (e.g., progressing further before failure)
            5. If the test passes or shows improvement with your fix, create a PR with:
               - Clear title describing the fix
               - Description explaining the root cause and solution
               - Test results showing the fix works
               - Reference to the failing CI run
            6. Use the base branch 'master' for the PR
