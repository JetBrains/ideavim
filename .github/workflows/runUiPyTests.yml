          Please analyze the UI test failures in the current directory.

          Key information:
          - Test reports are located in: build/reports and tests/ui-py-tests/build/reports
          - There is a video recording in build/reports/video that shows what happened during the tests - this video is usually very useful for understanding what went wrong visually
          - IDE sandbox logs are in the idea-sandbox-log directory
          - ffmpeg is already installed and available - you can use it to extract frames from the video or analyze it if that would be helpful

          Please provide:
          1. A detailed analysis of what went wrong
          2. The root cause of the failure
          3. Potential fixes or suggestions
