            ## Task: Analyze UI Test Failures

            Please analyze the UI test failures in the current directory.

            Key information:
            - Test reports are located in: build/reports and tests/ui-rd-tests/build/reports
            - There is a video recording in build/reports/video that shows what happened during the tests - this video is usually very useful for understanding what went wrong visually
            - There is also a single screenshot at tests/ui-rd-tests/build/reports/ideaVimTest.png showing the state when the test failed
            - IDE sandbox logs are in the idea-sandbox-log directory
            - ffmpeg is already installed and available - you can use it to extract frames from the video or analyze it if that would be helpful

            Please provide:
            1. A detailed analysis of what went wrong
            2. The root cause of the failure
            3. Potential fixes or suggestions

            Write your analysis to build/reports/ai-analysis.txt
