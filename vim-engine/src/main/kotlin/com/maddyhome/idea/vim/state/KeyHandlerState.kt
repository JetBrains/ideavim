    // Create a new command builder for commands entered inside the command line, which allows for nested commands, such
    // as inserting a digraph while entering a search pattern as a delete motion - `d/foo<C-K>OK`.
    // When matching an action that opens a command line, the new builder is created before the action is added to a
    // builder, which means it gets added to the new command line builder. Since there are no arguments required by the
    // action, the command is completed and executed (and the command line builder reset), and the command line UI is
    // opened.
    // When matching an action that accepts or cancels a command line, the command line builder is removed before the
    // action is added, so it is added to the editor's command line builder. The key handler recognises the action to
    // accept the command line, and will add the command line contents as an argument, and then execute the command.
    // The user might have already entered some state in the editor command builder, specifically uncommitted count.
    // E.g., the user might have typed `3:` expecting the command line to be displayed with `:.,.+2` as initial text, or
    // started something like `2d3/foo` to delete up to the 6th occurrence of `foo`. (In both examples, the uncommitted
    // count is `3`.)
    // We pass the current, in progress count for the editor command builder to the new command line builder, where it
    // becomes the count for the new action. The `:` handler will transform it into a range, while the search handler
    // will ignore it.
    // In other words, the `:` handler uses the count eagerly, where it becomes part of the command line that is
    // executed (by the editor command builder) when the command line UI is closed. But the search handler doesn't use
    // it - it's needed by the search motion action executed by the editor command builder once the command line UI is
    // accepted. For this reason, we do NOT clear the uncommitted count from the editor command builder. A command such
    // as `2d3/foo` becomes a delete operator action with a search action motion argument, which itself has an Ex string
    // argument with the search string. The command has a count of `6`. And a command such as `3:p` becomes an action to
    // process Ex entry with an argument of `.,.+2p` and a count of 3. The count is ignored by this action.
    // Note that we use the calculated count. In Vim, `2"a3"b:` transforms to `:.,.+5`, which is the same behaviour
