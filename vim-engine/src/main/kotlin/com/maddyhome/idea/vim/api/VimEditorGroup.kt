   * those that have not yet been initialised, so the plugin can correctly initialise them. When the plugin starts, the

   * Get a collection of all initialised editors

   * This will return all editors, including both main file editors and other editors in the UI such as the commit
   * message editor. Editors will have been initialised by IdeaVim - any listeners installed, all options set, etc. This
   * is important to prevent using editors in listener callbacks (such as option change notifications) before they've
   * been initialised.
   *
   * Implementors should take care to only return "local" editors. I.e., for IntelliJ, this function will not include
   * hidden editors that are used to handle requests from Code With Me guests.
   *
   * Note that this function returns editors for all projects, which is necessary because IdeaVim does not maintain
   * state per-project. This can have surprising consequences, such as search highlights updating across all open
   * top-level project frames, which is at odds with the behaviour of separate top-level windows in GVim/MacVim.
   *
   * Also note that it is possible for multiple editors in different projects to open the same file (document/buffer).
