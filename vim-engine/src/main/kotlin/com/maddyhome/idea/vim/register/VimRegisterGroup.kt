   * While this method allows setting the unnamed register, this should only be done from tests, and only when it's
   * not possible to yank or cut from the fixture editor. This method will skip additional text processing, and won't
   * update other registers such as the small delete register or reorder the numbered registers. It is much more
   * preferable to yank from the fixture editor.
