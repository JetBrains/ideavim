/**
 * Every line in [VimEditor] ends with a new line TODO <- this is probably not true already
 *
 * # New line and line count
 *
 * In vim **every** line always ends with a new line character. If you'll open a file that doesn't end with
 *   a new line and save it without a modification, the new line character will be automatically added.
 * This is not how the most editors work. The file and the line may end without a new character symbol.
 * This affects a [lineCount] public function. A three-lines file in vim contains four lines in other editors.
 * Also this complicated deletion logic.
 *
 * At the moment, we consider a what-user-sees approach. A file with two lines where every line ends with
 *   a new line character, is considered as a three-lines file because it's represented in the editor like this.
 *
 * TODO: We should understand what logic changes if we use a two or three lines editors.
 *
 * ---
 * # Offset and range deletion
 *
 * [Offset] is a position between characters.
 * A `delete` method, that works on offset-offset, deletes the character *between* two offsets. That means that:
 * - It's possible and simply applicable when the start offset is larger than end offset
 * - Inclusive/Exclusive words are not applicable to such operation. So we don't define the operation
 *      like "... with end offset exclusive". However, technically, the "right" or the "larger" offset is exclusive.
 *
 * ## Other decisions review:
 * - End offset exclusive:
 *   This is a classic approach, that is used in most APIs, however, it's inconvenient for the case where the
 *     start offset is larger than end offset (direction switching) because for such offset switching it turns that
 *     start offset is exclusive and end offset is inclusive.
 * - End offset inclusive:
 *   This approach is convenient for direction switching, however, makes the situation that empty range cannot be
 *     specified. E.g. range 1:1 would delete the character under `1`, however it looks like that nothing should be
 *     deleted.
 *  Also, during the development it turned out that using such approach causes a lot of `+1` and `-1` operations that
 *     seem to be redundant.
 *
 * ---
 * # Offset and pointer
 *
 * It seems line it would be helpful to split "string offset" into [Pointer] and [Offset] where [Pointer] referrers
 *   to a concrete existing character and [Offset] referrers to an in-between position.
 * Apart from semantic improvement (methods like `insertAt(Offset)`, `deleteAt(Pointer)` seem to be more obvious),
 *   looks like it may fix some concrete issues where we pass one type as a parameter, which is a different type.
 *   For example, let's delete a first character on the line. For the classic code it would look like
 *   ```
 *   public fun lineStart(line: Int): Int
 *   public fun deleteAt(offset: Int)
 *
 *   public val lineStart = data.lineStart(x)
 *   data.deleteAt(lineStart)
 *   ```
 *   This code compiles and looks fine. However, with [Offset] and [Pointer] approach it would fail
 *   ```
 *   public fun lineStart(line: Int): Offset // <- return the removed position
 *   public fun deleteAt(offset: Pointer)
 *
 *   public val lineStart: Offset = data.lineStart(x)
 *   data.deleteAt(lineStart) // ERROR: incorrect argument type
 *   ```
 *   So, we have to convert the [Offset] to [Pointer] somehow and during the conversion we may observe the problem
 *   that the line may contain no characters at all (at the file end). So the code is either semantically incorrect,
 *   or we should convert an [Offset] to [Pointer] keeping the fact that [Offset] is not exactly the [Pointer].
 *   ```
 *   ...
 *   public fun Offset.toPointer(forData: String): Pointer? {
 *     return if (this < forData.length) Pointer(this) else null
 *   }
 *
 *   public val lineFirstCharacter: Pointer = data.lineStart(x).toPointer(data)
 *   if (lineFirstCharacter != null) {
 *     data.deleteAt(lineFirstCharacter)
 *   }
 *   ```
 *
 * ---
 * # Lines
 *
 * We use two types of line reference: Offset and pointer. Offset referrers to a between-lines position.
 *   Pointer referrers to the concrete line.
 *
 * TODO We should check if we can keep the same VimEditor instance between edits.
 *   For example, can we store local options right in the editor implementation?
 *
 * ## Line kinds
 *
 * See `:help definitions`. Vim has the following types of lines:
 *
 * * "buffer lines" - the lines of the text buffer, as stored on disk. Equivalent to IntelliJ's `LogicalPosition`.
 *   Represented with [BufferPosition].
 * * "logical lines" - the lines of the text buffer, with folds applied. Folds in Vim are complete lines, but can be
 *   arbitrary ranges in IntelliJ, meaning a Vim logical line in IdeaVim can start and end on different buffer lines.
 * * "window lines" (sometimes referred to as "display" in the help) - the lines displayed in a window, including soft
 *   wrapped lines. These lines provide the character grid of the window, and the top left corner of the window is
 *   always `(0,0)`, regardless of the scroll state or wrap setting of the window's text. There is no representation in
 *   IdeaVim. IntelliJ's `VisualPosition` is similar, but is relative to the top of the text buffer, not the window. As
 *   such, IntelliJ does not have a direct equivalent. To avoid confusion with GUI windows, IdeaVim's API will use the
 *   word "display".
 * * "screen lines" - the lines of all windows, as well as status lines and the command line. IdeaVim does not support
 *   this and has no such representation.
 *
 * Unless otherwise noted, the vim-engine API will use buffer lines. Any parameter or variable called `line` will be a
 * buffer line. When required, Vim logical lines will use an appropriate type to represent a buffer start and end line,
 * and IntelliJ visual lines will be clearly marked in the parameter or variable name, e.g. `visualLine`.
 * ([VimVisualPosition] should be phased out if possible, as it is an IntelliJ concept, not a Vim concept.)
