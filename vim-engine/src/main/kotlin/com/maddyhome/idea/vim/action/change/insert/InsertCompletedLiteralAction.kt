  /**
   * Perform additional initialisation when starting to wait for an argument
   *
   * IdeaVim has two ways of handling digraphs/literals. Actions such as `r` or `f` can accept a digraph, which really
   * means it accepts a character, but the user can use `<C-K>`/`<C-V>` to type a digraph or literal and convert it into
   * a character. Unfortunately, there is no mode that can be used to register an "insert digraph/literal" action for
   * these keys while replace or find is active. So the key handler hard codes these keys and will check for them when
   * an action expects a digraph (and like Vim, these keys cannot be mapped). Once the state machine has matched a
   * character, the expected argument is reset to [Argument.Type.CHARACTER] and the character is passed through the key
   * handler again, potentially mapped, and then attached as an argument to the current command, which is now complete
   * and executed.
   *
   * In Insert and Command-line mode, the `<C-K>` and `<C-V>` keys are actions that will wait for a character argument,
   * and then insert it. Commands are only executed once complete, so we use [onStartWaitingForArgument] to start the
   * digraph state machine. This also gives us a repeatable command and captures the keys for `'showcmd'`.
