/**
 * Represents arguments used when executing a command - either an action, operator or motion
 *
 * TODO: Remove, rename or otherwise refactor this class
 *
 * Problems with this class:
 * * The name is misleading, as it is used when executing motions that do not have an operator, as well as when
 *   executing the operator itself. Or even when executing actions that are neither operators nor motions
 * * It is not clear if this represents the arguments to an operator (while the operator's [Command] also has arguments)
 * * [mode] is the mode _before_ the command is completed, which is not guaranteed to be the same as the mode once the
 *   command completes. There is no indication of this difference, which could lead to confusion
 * * The count is (correctly) the count for the whole command, rather than the operator, or the operator's arguments
 *   (the in-progress motion)
 *
 * @param isOperatorPending Deprecated. The value is used to indicate that a command is operator+motion and was
 * previously used to change the behaviour of the motion (the EOL character is counted in this scenario - see
 * `:help whichwrap`). It is better to register a separate action for [Mode.OP_PENDING] rather than expect a runtime
 * flag for something that can be handled statically.
 * @param count0 The raw count of the entire command. E.g., if the command is `2d3w`, then this count will be `6`, even
 * when this class is passed to the `d` operator action (the count applies to the motion).
 * @param mode Deprecated. The mode of the editor at the time that the [OperatorArguments] is created, which is _before_
 * the command is completed. This was previously used to check for [Mode.OP_PENDING], but is no longer required. Prefer
 * [VimEditor.mode] instead.
