/**
 * Represents an argument to a command's action
 *
 * A [Command] is made up of an optional register and count, and an action. That action might be a simple command such
 * as `i` to start Insert mode, or a motion `w` to move to the next word. Or it might require an argument, such as a
 * character like in the motion `fx` or an ex-string in the command `d/foo`. Or it might be another action, representing
 * a motion, such as `dw`. That motion argument's action might itself have an action (`dfx`).

  /**
   * Represents an argument that is a motion. Used by operator commands
   *
   * A command is either an action (like `i`), a motion (like `w`) or an operator that takes a motion as an argument
   * (like `dw`). A motion argument is a motion action handler with its own optional argument. The motion action handler
   * could be a [MotionActionHandler] or [TextObjectActionHandler], or even the [ExternalActionHandler] that tracks the
   * caret moves from an external action such as EasyMotion/AceJump. A motion might be a simple motion such as `w` to
   * move a word, or require a character argument (`f`), or even an ex-string (`/foo`).
   *
   * Note that a motion argument does not have a count - that is owned by the fully built command. When executing the
   * command, the count applies to the motion action, not the operator action. This just means the operator action
   * does not use the count. (`3i` means insert the following typed text three times. But `3cw` means change the next
   * three words with the following inserted text, rather than change the next word by inserting the following text
   * three times.)
