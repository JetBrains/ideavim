 * the status bar widget when `'showcmd'` changes, or updating the default register when `'clipboard'` changes, or
 * enabling/disabling extensions.
 *
 * This function will always be called before [EffectiveOptionValueChangeListener.onEffectiveValueChanged].

/**
 * Listener for changes to the effective value of an option
 *
 * The effective value of an option is the value that is in effect for a given editor. When an option changes, this
 * interface function will be called for all affected options. For global options, all open editors will be notified
 * for all changes in all scopes. For local-to-buffer options, all editors for the buffer are notified when the local
 * or [OptionAccessScope.EFFECTIVE] scope changes. For local-to-window options, the editor specified by [OptionAccessScope.LOCAL] or
 * [OptionAccessScope.EFFECTIVE] will be notified. There will be no notifications to changes to the global scope of local
 * options. If a global-local option's local value is changed, the affected buffer or window editor(s) will be notified.
 * If its global value is changed, all editors where the value is unset will be notified (this includes the current
 * buffer or window's editor(s)).
