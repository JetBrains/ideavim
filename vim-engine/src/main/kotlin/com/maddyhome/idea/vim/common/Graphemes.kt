//
// RATIONALE:
//
// As an alternative to implementing this ourselves, we could make use of the ICU4J — the implementation
// of the unicode related properties and algorithms maintained by the unicode organisation.
//
// The reason why it wasn't done so is twofold:
//   1. ICU4J is a fairly big library, that provides the complete support for the Unicode specification,
//      while at this moment all we need is a small subset of that functionality, namely the grapheme
//      cluster boundaries search.
//
//   2. The exposed API is a little awkward to use and would require adapters to be efficient.
//      To iterate over the grapheme cluster boundaries using ICU4J, one could employ the implementation
//      of the `java.text.BreakIterator` provided by the library.
//
//      Given the specifics of the memory access patterns in the vim-engine with respect to grapheme
//      cluster boundaries search (random access, only certain commands will ever care about the boundaries),
//      using the sequential `BreakIterator` isn't very efficient. It also does quite a bit of extra
//      work to enable faster random access of the areas that were visited before by maintaining a partial
//      index.
//
//      JDK21 exposes a similar implementation of the `java.text.BreakIterator` interface, except it's
//      even less efficent: upon the iterator creation, the full traversal of the given text is performed
//      to build a full index over all the grapheme cluster boundaries, making the use of the said iterator
//      O(n) both by time and memory.
//
//      We could still consider that option just for the sake of reducing the amount of code that we have
//      to maintain, once JDK21 is released. The ineffiency can be reduced by taking a small fragment of
//      the text and increase the size if no boundaries were found, although the amount of extra work
//      is still substantial.
//
//      Ironically, one of the packages of the JDK21 has almost exactly what we need (a very similar API
//      to the one implemented here), but it is an internal package (`jdk.internal.util.regex`).
