## 1.11.0, 2022-08-09

### Features:
* Add `gcu` command for Commentary plugin
* Add `:Commentary` command, which works great for commands such as `:%g/fun/Commentary`
* Support `gc` â€“ commentary text objects. E.g. `dgc`: delete commented text.
* Support `redo-register feature` | [VIM-2643](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/VIM-2643/Dot-operator-doesn-t-increment-number-register-after-pasting-fro) | [viminfo](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/undo.html#redo-register)

### Changes:
* Uses the same mappings as Commentary, so custom bindings for the Vim plugin will work with IdeaVim, too.
  E.g. `<Plug>Commentary` instead of `<Plug>(CommentMotion)`. Old mappings are maintained for compatibility.
* If you open `~/.ideavimrc` in IDE, remove a mapping, and reload the config using the reload button,
  the mapping will actually be unmapped.
* New vim (and IdeaVim) behaviour: `ci(`& friends searches for the brackets in the line.

## 0.61, 2020-11-12

### Features:
* Ability to map IDE actions via the `<Action>` keyword. E.g. `map <C-K> <Action>(CommentByLineComment)`.
  Check out `README.md` for the details.
* `IdeaVim: track action Ids` command to find action ids for the `:action` command.
  Enable this option in "Search everywhere" (double shift).
* Ability to enable extensions using `vim-plug` or `vundle` syntax.  
  E.g. to enable commentary extension you can use one of the following commands:
  ```vim
  set commentary
  Plug 'tpope/vim-commentary'
  Plug 'https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary'
  Plugin 'tpope/vim-commentary'
  ...
  ```
  This approach is especially handy if you have `.vimrc` with plugins registered via `vim-plug` or `vundle`.

Previous Releases
-----------------

... from 0.8.4

  Ctrl-Shift-F7, for example.
- :quit command now works in all forms (e.g. :q, :qu, :qui, :quit).
- Performing a change command while in visual mode now properly terminates
  visual mode.
- Fixed internal error caused when trying to use visual mode with IDEA's
  "column mode".

0.8.3 from 0.8.2
Bug Fixes
- After a fresh install it is possible to get a NPE when loading the first
  project. Now fixed.

Bug Fixes
- Updated to show up in the plugin list for Pallada.
- Fixed NullPointerException when using the :qall, :q, or :wq commands.

0.8.0 from 0.7.3
New Features
- Support for Pallada (IDEA 4.5)
- Support for the hlsearch option and the :nohlsearch command. Now when a
  search is done, all matching text is highlighted. The highlight attributes
  are based on the "General|Search result" color setting. (Not for 4.0.x)
- Support for aw, aW, iw, and iW while in visual mode or as arguments to the
  y, gu, gU, g~, c, d, and ! commands.
  
Bug Fixes

- b and B while on the first word of a file didn't work.

0.7.3 from 0.7.2

New Features
- Added support for digraphs. Currently you can use Ctrl-k {char1}{char2} to
  enter a special character. This works while in Insert/Replace mode, as an
  argument to the r, F, T, f, and t commands, or while entering an ex command.
  The :digraphs command has been added to display the currently supported
  digraphs. Certain special cases of the Ctrl-K {char1}{char2} sequence are not
  supported. This supports all two character digraphs as listed in RFC1345.
  This amounts to 1,338 digraphs! Ensure the file encoding can handle the
  characters you enter.

  {char1} [BackSpace] {char2}. This works in Insert/Replace mode or while
  entering an ex command.
- Added support for Ctrl-v {digits}. This works while in Insert/Replace mode,
  as an argument to the r, F, T, f, and t commands, or while entering an ex
  command.
- A new Vim.xml keymap needs to be installed or Ctrl-K needs to be removed
  from all source control menus.

Bug Fixes

  all files use the :wall command.
- Enhanced the :e command. Support for :e# and :e <filename> have been added.
  :e# selects the previous tab. :e <filename> will search the entire project
  and open the first matching file. Relative paths are supported too. :e with
  no argument will still bring up the File Open dialog.
- Added support for the gP and gp commands.
- Added support for the z+ and z^ commands.

  - Make the VIM tool window docked.
  - Turn off auto-hide for the VIM tool window.
  - Shrink the tool window so just the window title is visible.
  - Do not move the VIM tool window to the left or right - leave on the bottom
    or top.
- Various error messages are now displayed in the new status bar.
- Added support for : register
- Added support for / register

New Commands
- Added support for q{register} command - macro recording.
- Added support for @{register} and @@ commands - playback register contents.
- Added support for :@{register}, :@@, and :@: - run register as command or
  repeat last :@ command.

New :set Options
- showmode is now supported.

Bug Fixes
- Hitting escape while entering a search string resulted in a search for the
  previous search string instead of doing nothing.
- The :registers command didn't display trailing newlines in a register
- Fixed focus problem if user hits escape in the find dialog after entering
  the :find command.
- All the search and substitute commands acted strangely if the text contained
  real tab characters. Tabs are now properly handled.
- gd and gD weren't working in read-only files.

0.3.2 from 0.3.1

New Commands
- Added support for {visual}!{filter}, !{motion}{filter}, and !!{filter}.
- Added support for [p, ]p, [P, ]P - put text but do not autoindent. Note -
  This plugin's support for putting text with or without proper indenting is
  reversed from VIM.

New Features
- Entering a count before the v or V command to start Visual mode is now
  supported.
- Repeating Visual commands is now supported.

Bug Fixes
- Now properly handle :0, :1, and :<negative> commands
- More problems with Visual mode - none of the visual change commands left
  you in insert mode after deleting the text and undo wouldn't put the text
  back.
- Fixed the handling of undo/redo with regard to text added to a file while not
  in insert mode. This can happen with the use of the Generate... menu for
  adding constructors, getters, etc. This also can happen when IDEA adds an
  import statement automatically. This also allows you to undo import
  optimizations!
- Doing a cw or cW when the cursor is already on the end of a word/WORD now
  correctly deletes only the last character of the word/WORD and not the next
  word too.
- gd and gD now properly save the jump location before moving to the
  declaration.
- z<Enter>, z-, and z. now move the cursor to the start of the line.
- Visual mode is now exited after issuing the = or gq command.
- The commands c% and d% where not removing the closing match as expected.
- The d{motion} command now becomes linewise when the motion covers more than
  one line and there is just whitespace before the start and after the end.
- Renamed some source files to avoid problems on case insensitive platforms.
- Entering a count for the . (repeat) command sometimes results in an internal
  error.
- Repeating an R command resulted in the text being inserted instead of
  overwriting old text. This now works properly.
- Issuing a p command when on the last line of a file pasted the line before
  the last line instead of after the last line.

0.3.1 from 0.3.0

New Commands
- Added support for [w, ]w, [b, and ]b. These move the cursor forward to start
  of next camel word, forward to end of next camel word, backward to start of
  previous camel word, and backward to end of previous camel word respectively.
  These are NOT in VIM but are very useful when working with mixed case method
  and variable names. Like their normal w, e, b, and ge counterparts, these may
  be used as operators for the c and d commands.
- :qall, :quitall, :wqall, and :xall - closes all editors.
- :wall - same as :write - save all files.
- :xit and :exit - same :wq - save files and close current editor.
- :close and :hide - same as :quit - close current editor.
- :only - Close all editors except the current editor.
- :display - same as :registers - display register contents.
- :undo - same as u - undo last change.
- :redo - same as Ctrl-R - redo last undone change.
- :wnext - save files and move to next editor.
- :wNext and :wprevious - save files and move to previous editor.

Changed Commands
- ZZ, ZQ, :q and :wq will not exit IDEA anymore

Bug Fixes
- Visual mode became unusable without doing a Ctrl-\ Ctrl-n command after each
  visual mode command. This unstable mode also caused undo to work improperly
  resulting in garbled text.
- Ex commands that take a count instead of a range (:next, :Next, etc.) were
  getting the current line number as the count instead of one.
- The == command can now be repeated with the . command.
- Backslashes (\) in the replace text of a :substitute command was not being
  handled correctly in all cases.

  the user back to insert mode before they could enter the command.
